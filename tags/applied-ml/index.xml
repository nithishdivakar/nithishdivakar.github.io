&lt;p&gt;The problem is simple; $m$ movies, $n$ users and we have the data of rating of movies by users. Now in reality, each user might have rated a few movies while total number of users and movies are huge. We can consider the whole ratings data as a matrix $n\times m$ matrix $R$ where $R_{ij}$ is the rating of $i^{th}$ movie by $j^{th}$ user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want a model which can predict the rating a user would have given a movie. Now the modelling part is easy as a matrix factorisation problem. We can assume every user is represented by a embedding $u_i$ and similarly, every movie has a embedding $m_j$. We simply want $$R_{ij} \sim { u_i}^\intercal m_j$$ If we simply model the learning problem as
$$\mathop{\mathrm{arg,min}}_{U,M} \| {U}^\intercal M - R \|_2$$
then we are implicitly assuming that all unavailable ratings are $0$. Since we have only a few ratings compared to all possible combinations of movies and users, the model will get biased towards $0$ ratings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
